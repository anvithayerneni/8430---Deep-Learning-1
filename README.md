Overview
This document summarizes the development and findings of three neural network models designed to explore deep learning concepts and techniques. Each model is tailored to perform specific tasks, emphasizing regularization, optimization, and understanding the effects of model complexity on performance.

Models Description
Model 1: A seven-layer dense network utilizing RMSProp, MSELoss, and weight decay for regularization. Optimized for a learning rate of 0.001.
Model 2: Consists of four dense layers with 571 parameters, employing RMSProp, leaky ReLU, and a weight decay of 0.0001. It focuses on balancing complexity with efficiency.
Model 3: A more straightforward, single-layer model with 571 parameters, using optimization and regularization techniques similar to those in Model 2.

Functions and Demonstrations
Function1: Visual and mathematical analysis of the function (sin(5πx)/(5πx)), including model performance over epochs and loss evaluations.
Function 2: Analysis and visual representation of sgn(sin(5πx)/5πx), with insights into model convergence and learning challenges.

Training and Evaluation
Models trained on the MNIST dataset, incorporating different architectures, including convolutional layers and variations in depth and complexity.
Evaluation based on loss metrics, accuracy, and convergence, demonstrating the impact of layer depth and regularization techniques on model performance.

Findings and Insights
Models with more layers and complexity tend to achieve faster convergence and lower loss, highlighting the importance of architectural decisions.
Overfitting is observed in scenarios with high model complexity versus available data, emphasizing the need for careful parameter and architecture tuning.

Generalization Experiments
Experiments with random labels, varying model sizes, and batch sizes to study generalization, with findings on overfitting and model sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Conclusion
The homework explores deep learning fundamentals through practical experiments, demonstrating the critical balance between model complexity, regularization, and optimization for effective learning.
